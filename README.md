App created using React, Bootstrap.

Just a very simple single webpage grocery list. For now, use is to use as grocery list for when you're about to go to the groceries so you don't forget what you need. Later use will be updated to where you can sign in and have it remember what groceries you have at home, and when you run out it will send an alert to let you know what you need and automatically add to grocery list. Updates will be coming soon yet slowly, as I'm busy with school and work.

Made this as a way to practice react, bootstrap, css, and eventually postgresql, and full-stack deployment.
